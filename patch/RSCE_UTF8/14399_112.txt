<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith> isn't here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where the heck did you
go at this time of night?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith>.
What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey big brother, it's unusual
for you to be up at this hour.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're usually such a sleepyhead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I kind of woke up suddenly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big brother. Do you
remember Mom and Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mom and Dad, what about them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sometimes I miss Mom and Dad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you ever felt that
way about them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess I used to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hardly ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, is
that okay with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I want to hear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was when you were
still very small, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You had a terrible fever once,
you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I didn't know that happened.
I don't remember anything about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa happened to be out
of the house at the time, and
there was no one at home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I really thought that
you were going to die.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The thought of that terrified me,
and I didn't know what to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
At that time, I really wished  that
Mom and Dad would come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then a miracle happened,
and my fever went down?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
On the contrary, Your face
became redder and redder.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were in so much pain that you
were calling out to Mom and
Dad like a baby.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I saw that, I suddenly
felt like I had to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I immediately took you and
ran to the village chief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then the village chief rushed
to call a doctor for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I'm even able to talk
to you like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? But why was that the
last time you wanted to see
Mom or Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's because they're not here
anymore. They can't help protect
<Lilith>, even if they wanted to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why when I was too scared to
do anything, they came to me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They said, "Be brave and protect
your sister, <Stahn>."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought maybe they were
trying to cheer me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since then, I feel like Mom and
Dad are always there for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. I don't know how to describe
it, but I guess it's like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to bed, <Lilith>.
I'm starting to feel sleepy again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, what's up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I could stay with
my brother forever, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to be
protected forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will I be able to protect someone
one day, like you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not something I can know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah, I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But when the time comes for <Lilith>
to truly want to protect someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Dad and Mom will
come to <Lilith>'s side and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think they'll support her as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for telling me
all this, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>I saw something I shouldn't have seen.
[ENDBLOCK]
select
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to rest?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, <Lilith> is gone.
Where did she go?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
When I told my granddaughter
about the legendary carrot, she
ran out of the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I think she's still near the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
The legendary carrots are
said to be in the forest far
to the south of this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that some monsters
are guarding the carrots.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful.

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
The legendary carrots are

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Lilith> for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a soldier of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure my grandchildren
are in the midst of working
on that dream right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If we meet somewhere else,
please let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is your home. Make yourself
at home as much as you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you will all feel at home here
and relax as much as you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Follow the path you believe in,
<Stahn>. That is the way of life
for a man of House Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
From my point of view, <Stahn>
is still a child. Thank you very
much for your cooperation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you have your work cut
out for you. You can't just sit
here and dawdle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> and <Stahn>, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are tired, please
come back anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, you've got a good look.
You'll be fine then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah... You're the one
from back then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come to see me, by chance?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I gave up looking
for the legendary carrot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I don't want you to come
into mine and my brother's room
without permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet you're hungry. Do you want
me to make you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you hungry, also?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the shopping
for dinner, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't forgive you if you forget
your promise, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to worry about
me or grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When it's all over and you come
back, I'll make you a feast.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell you the truth, I want my
brother to come home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen, Grandpa.
He's a terrible brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What the heck, <Stahn>, you're still
annoying <Lilith>, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really mean to be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not aware of it,
and that's the problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you really can't
do anything without me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if it's just family, that's fine...
But I hope you didn't bother your
companions during your journey.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure it's fine...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveling...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already been three months since
then. I hope everyone is doing well...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

don't hesitate to come back.

Why don't you go home and rest
for the first time in a while?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I will.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
EEEEEK!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lilith>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you
see their face!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... I didn't get a very
good look at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. I'll go see if I can
find any suspicious people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I brought all the suspicious
people around the house that I saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, confess!
Who was it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right!
Confess immediately!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're under suspicion
too you know!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
M-Me too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got nothing to do with this.
Besides, it was <Bacchus>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea either but...
It was probably this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't MEEE!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, it wasn't <Bacchus>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, <Stahn>!
You understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true, big bro?
Well if that's the case...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the culprit is in here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you serious!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It wasn't me though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, who the heck peeked
into the bathroom then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Peeked into the...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
...Bathroom?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you show your
true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors...?
So it was this kid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, this kid's the
perpetrator in the Great
Bathroom Peeper Mystery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was gathering everyone up,
I didn't dare explain exactly why
I was doing it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Upon seeing <Lilith> angry,
these two reflexively denied
any wrong doing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They just knew that <Lilith>
being angry was really bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, give it up already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. I'm the one who peeked
into your bathroom window...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real cool big
brother. What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.

Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what the heck are
you doing, you idiot!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, that was
really cool of you, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I was real suprised there,
it's like you turned into a
completely different person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Nah... I just... was actin' like
the main character in a book
I read a long time ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the best, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I'm back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feared you had someting to do
with that thing in the sky. I've been
worrying about you for so long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew, but I'm really glad. It looks
like your business is done, too.
[ENDBLOCK]

Huh?

<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't "Huh?" me. What do you
want for dinner tonight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to ask me for
anything special today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
I'm not done with my business yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
//TODO fix this
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no... I knew it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it would come to this, ever
since I saw my brother off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you're still in the middle
of your business...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So what should you be doing
right now, big brother!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since you left, I've been

[ENDBLOCK]
Your decision...
You said that I shouldn't sway it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And most importantly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said I had to be strong too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, big brother. Swear to
me that you'll do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll bring back the peaceful
sky once again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear to you, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will be stronger than anyone
else so that my favorite brother's
promise can be kept!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you must
keep your promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you too, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!

I've never seen your face before.
Are you from Fitzgald?

My name is <Stahn>. I'm from

[ENDBLOCK]
Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well they call me,
Chatty Old Man. Nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The... Chatty Old Man...?
Well, it's nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. Contact with people is a
once in a lifetime opportunity.
Treasure it.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Con...tact?

Okay. Now, go

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you've got things to do now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, Jonathan?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't
be able to hit something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't
be able to hit something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it's about bows, I'm the
girl you need to know!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This young lady?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is very good with a bow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll ask you to do it, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
There was something stuck on the
top of the tree in front of my house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I think if you hit the arrow
close enough, it will fall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I understand.
I think I'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have to help with something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay, <Lilith>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be right back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're early.
Are you done already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'm done with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an egg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this what's been bugging you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hatched!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, she's so cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a little afraid of...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not fair, <Lilith>!
I'm the one who found you. Buu.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think <Lilith>
is your mother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> will be responsible
for taking care of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh~. My brother is enough for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take him for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take him for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd it go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was really nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, but what are you
going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa. Can I ask you to
take care of her for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still going to be
with <Stahn>, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I'm sad to leave her, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
It's cute to think of him
as our third grandchild.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, Grandpa?
"Great-grandchild".
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ho-ho-ho. That's right.
You're <Lilith>'s child, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Grandpa.
Where's the girl?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where she is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we have to find her!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did that girl just spontaneously
disappear?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did she grow up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. she's much, much more grown
than I was when I was born.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it was a nesting trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sad that I won't be able
to see him anymore, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a mother.
I should be happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right <Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's too early for your
brother to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him, maybe
he'll bring his wife and kids!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If something like that happens,
<Lilith> can't be bothered with
<Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give me a break~.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ho-ho-ho.<x00>
