[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's
the same here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Why won't they
buy our lens!?
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that
rumor was true!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys, listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ship meant to transport money here is delayed
The rumor IS true, but please calm down!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation's
money transport broke down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a replacement
on the way soon, though!
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true!?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rumors are true,
but please calm down!
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was true after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Buy my lens first!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, listen. It seems that the
Oberon Corporation's transport
ship ran into some trouble,
so it's running a little behind schedule.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that rumor
was true after all...
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case,
all we can do is wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation
made a mistake and forgot
to schedule a ship
to come here until tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah well, no choice
but wait, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it okay for you to be lying?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was a last ditch effort
to maintain public order.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no other choice...
I'd like to think it was the right one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Things'll calm
down a bit, for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, I have a feeling
this is going to cause the
exchange rate to become unstable...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take that over
not being able to
exchange lens at all, though.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The recent uproar has caused

Is it okay for
you to lie like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I certainly don't like to.
However, I couldn't just
let <Stahn> lie alone like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on is
troubling my people, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no choice, this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe the lens rate will
stabilize after this, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess things
will calm down now.

Near the city?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The sky was covered by the Shell.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
A big hole was made in the Shell in
the neighboring country. I heard
they used a big weapon!
[ENDBLOCK]

I wonder what it looks like above
the Shell. I wish I could go see it.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
