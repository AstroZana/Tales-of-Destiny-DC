<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a pretty stubborn guy. Now
cough it up! Tell us what you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh! I dunno nothin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, any more
than this will...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! What are
you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a typical
interrogation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Typical!? <Batista>'s
covered in bruises!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm doing what's
necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>, please. Please
tell us where <Greybum> is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
So now the timid <Philia> thinks she
can order me around? When did
you  get so full of yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. I'll tell you something,
for old times' sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
We didn't come here
just to attack the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me... That one ship
from the armada, could it be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, could <Greybum>
have been on that ship!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to see what's right
under your nose, as they say!
Even if you realize it now, it's
too late!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...We're getting nowhere...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...Fine. If that's
how he wants it...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, I'm putting your
tiara on <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're taking it off...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you don't
want him to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's so cute...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd feel bad forcing her to do it,
so why not take mine instead?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right. It's because
you don't trust me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no interest in
dressing like a woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see you keep that
tough-guy act going after this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
UGWAAAAH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ggh... Heh... is...
...that all ya got...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you're
going too far!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. That's enough for now.
We'll continue this tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>... Why are
you doing this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>, I've brought
you breakfast.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? The door...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-<Batista>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>'s gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. When I came up here,
the door was open.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it locks from the outside,
so how did he...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe he has connections?
Someone on the inside who let him out...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, this is bad.
Someone let <Batista> out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
During the night, I silently
unlocked the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then you let him go with the
intention of watching his movements?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what the
tiara is for.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get it, since there's a tracking
device in it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, where is <Batista>...?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick
from all aquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

	objective of the Rock Rally game.
3: The rock will return to its original
	location when you enter or leave
	a city or dungeon.
