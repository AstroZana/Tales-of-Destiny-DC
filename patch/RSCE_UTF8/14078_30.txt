[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, but I hardly
ever come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes. Since we're here,
we might as well grab my
favorite instrument.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way... you don't mean
this giant piano, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep, you've got it. Okay, <Stahn>,
I need you to go lift up that side for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, uh, well, okay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Jeez, that was too easy.
I was joking, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, where did I put it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That wasn't funny, <Johnny>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I haven't touched
this piano in a long, long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there a reason for that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
A long time ago,
my best friend...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, never mind. Anyway,
where did I put that instrument...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's try asking someone
here in the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're... Sakuraba!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Saku...raba...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Yup. Nice to meetcha.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yeah. Likewise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I take it there's a reason for
your sudden appearance?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, you haven't even
touched it even after so long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's no concern of yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
It still bugs you, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
...Do you want to know?
It might change how you see <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's okay then,
you don't have to tell me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, you're a real
nice guy. However...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
But I really want
to talk, so I'll talk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wha?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
It happened back when
<Johnny> and I were 13.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
There was a time when he and
I both liked the same girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
And one time when the
three of us were together...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
That girl said
something like...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
"<Johnny>'s not very
good with the piano..."
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so funny! That's all
it took to get this guy to
want to master the piano!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get to the point,
why are you here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh! I always thought
you were cool headed
and suave, <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't realize you had
such an adorable side!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>. You're kind
hearted by nature, but
I kinda hate you right now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh that's right.
So you're <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of the
now adorable <Johnny>
who can't play piano.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm in a good mood now, so how
about I play you a little present?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's a little something
I came up with recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh right, I happened to receive
an instrument in pretty good
condition. You can have it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I should be going now.
If I have the time, maybe
I'll stop by again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'd be fine if you didn't.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See ya.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, why'd he have to be the
one to end up with the instrument
we were looking for...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord's Son
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Brother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's unusual.
I can't believe you're home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Each island of Aquaveil has its
own lord, and one of them takes
the throne of the Great King.
[ENDBLOCK]
The current Great King is the
Lord of Terazzi. Before that,
it was his father...
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad that the Moreau territory
has been liberated. Now you just
have to figure out how to free
Terazzi as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a little late to say this, but
your father was tricked by <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't say this out loud, but when
he died, I felt my stomach drop.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's widely believed that Seinegald
is to blame for this incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect something like this
to happen right as the countries
started getting along...
[ENDBLOCK]
Be on your best behavior during your
travels, <Johnny>. We don't need
you causing an international incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please take care
of <Johnny>. ...But don't spoil him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, please save the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> may be the youngest
of my brothers, but he has a
unique charm all his own.
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please take
care of my brother.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
