Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to Heidelberg Castle!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
His Excellency <Darzen>
told me about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience hall.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
All we can do is to protect
this castle and the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We believe in your victory,
Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no one in this castle who
does not know your face.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no one in this castle 
who does not know your faces.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish His Majesty the 
best of luck in this war.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you the best of luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that the day of true
peace is still far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until true peace is restored,
we too will not complain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle was damaged in
the <Greybum> rebellion, but
it has finally been restored.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please
take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The restoration of the relations
with Cyril is progressing smoothly,
and His Majesty's life has a bright
future ahead of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought this would happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the pride of our kingdom,
the kingdom itself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
With the power of my sex appeal,
I think I can captivate His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's impossible to get close to
His Majesty because of that strange
little girl always hanging around him!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty! You're in such a
good mood...it must be that girl, huh.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty! You're in such a
good mood...it must be that girl, huh.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's impossible to get close to
His Majesty because of that strange
little girl always hanging around him!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Eek! You're scary, Your Majesty...
Really, you're harmless, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
You have such a serious demeanor,
so I guess I'll stop joking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I could be 
by your side, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, upon your
safe return we will throw 
the most lavish celebration!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have a big celebration once
everyone's back safe and sound!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
An ambush?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I warned you to get out of
this country. Why did you 
come here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I need to ask you something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And I didn't know you were
working with <Woodrow> Kelvin.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since it's come to this, there's
only one possible outcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it, Mr. <Dalis>! <Mary> told 
me about you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will listen to no more,
prepare yourselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why? ...Why must we 
cross blades!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>... Your beauty hasn't
changed in two years.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You fool...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, are you aware of what
<Greybum> is planning to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, calm yourself.
Let <Mary> do the talking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right. 
...Sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, what are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could he be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, no!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, please step aside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
To your feet, <Dalis> Vincent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm ready. I will take whatever
fate I am deserving of.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>! Please stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't stay here any longer.
Hurry and escape the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, heal your wounds. Then come 
back and visit me later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think you're doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to choose a different
path than my father's. I shall
work alongside you to improve
this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let us fight to the end, to decide
the path this country will take.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not with blades, but with words.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The son of Isaac the Wise is even
more wise than his father. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've... lost.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>... <Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not leaving.
I'll never leave you again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> wasn't really following
<Greybum>, was he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can only assume his name 
was used for recruitment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How underhanded of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>! I'll never forgive you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I need to ask a favor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to go with...
I want to be with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but this is where...
I'm... home now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to be a warrior,
I just want to be <Dalis>' wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Go ahead, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. It would be foolish to
say no when you're that sappy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you happiness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this okay, Master <Lion>?
She's a criminal, isn't she?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmph. I'll be sure to report this:
she was injured and we had no
choice but to abandon her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, everyone...
I'm so lucky...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for sparing <Dalis>'
life. I truly appreciate it
from the very bottom of my heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should be the one thanking you.
Thanks to you, I'm more prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
More prepared?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
One must be aware of their position
and responsibilities, as well as be 
prepared to take on everything life
throws at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In order to accomplish that, we must 
first defeat <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please be safe!
I believe you will be victorious!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which

1: Kicking a rock outside the

2: Battles don't affect the clearing
