[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been getting a lot of pocket
change recently, so my wallet is
heavy and hard to lug around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give me a second to adjust it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I expected something a
lot worse than this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought monsters
were gonna pop out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaahhhh, oh no! Quick!
Help pick it all up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was worried that
was gonna happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm one gald short.
Where is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Found it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you shouldn't run around like
that... If the cave floor collapses we'll
all be in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll risk it for the biscuit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>! Watch out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06>Wahhhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06>Wahhhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06><Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06><Rutee>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! <Rutee>! Are
you all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We found some 
rope. Grab on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess I caused you guys
some trouble. Sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wasn't expecting such
  an earnest apology.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Money is still super important
to me, but I'll try to be less
greedy from now on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It would've been bad if I had
gotten seriously hurt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. That's a
good way of looking at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks. I don't want to
trouble everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Too much!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Too much!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahaha, you said it together! You
two are one and the same!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just how are <Stahn> and I
the same? Don't insult me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You saying that is
even more insulting!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It feels like something about
<Rutee> has changed a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You might be right. Maybe
that's a good thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are they all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear their voices. Sounds
like they're okay, somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously, she's
always such a
pain...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, it would be better
to help them instead of 
complaining about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a deep pit. Even with the
three of us, it'll be difficult to
get them out of it on our own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
For now, let's return to Shiden.
We'll search for some rope there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Well, okay...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick
from all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
