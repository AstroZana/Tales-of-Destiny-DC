<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're here. This is the room with the
Guardian Dragon's control console.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we hold this place, we can stop
that Guardian Dragon, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait. I'm not going to let you
do anything more than you
already have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I recognize that voice.
Who was it again...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember! It's Mr. <Baruk> of the
Oberon Corporation. We met in Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have a good memory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's as I feared. Oberon's executives
were complicit in <Hugo>'s schemes. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you be a part
of his evil scheme?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your belief that our actions are
evil is yours alone, based on 
misguided earthly biases.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
In truth, we are guided by 
unshakeable ideals and are
resolute to see them through.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>, please don't do this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
The time for negotiations has passed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even should it cost me my life...
I will not waver in my beliefs...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Blocking out the sun with this outer
shell and tormenting innocent people
are part of these beliefs?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it that you're trying
to achieve through your actions?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
You deserve the truth. We seek the
revival of the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is my duty as a Calvalesian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
My ancestors were defeated in the
Aeth'er War. Ever since then, they have
suffered through untold hardships.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I shall be the vessel through which
they enact their retribution. I don't
expect you simpletons to understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There has to be another way
for you to help Cavalese...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese tried for generations.
It has led only to suffering.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... please continue my crusade
and fulfill the wish of my people...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, we don't have much time.
Quickly, to the control console.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Roger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did it work...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team. This is confirmation
that the Guardian Dragon is
no longer functional.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
This should reduce shield output.
We can now focus our efforts on
building a neutralization device.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Proceed through Deimos
and return to Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
From there you will move out
to Helraios via Rodeon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's working us to the bone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's time to move on, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>... did you really think that this
was the only way to help your people?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I cannot accept that...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick
from all aquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
