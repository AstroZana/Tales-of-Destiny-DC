<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, there you are!
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did everyone
leave already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. You should
have said goodbye!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm no good at that.
Well, I should be leaving, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the money <Hugo>
paid me, I can afford
to take it easy for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to risk
my life gathering lens, anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say, <Rutee>, where in Seinegald
is your hometown, anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not far from here, actually.
It's a town called Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? I'll come visit
you next time I'm in-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! Never!
You mustn't!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you understand? Promise me!
If you set foot inside Cresta,
I will never forgive you, you hear!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Okay, I got it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, I told you earlier that
people were waiting for me at home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not just one
or a couple people...
There's a lot of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm from an orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
An orphanage
full of children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They count on me to
earn money for them...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's why you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Incredible...
That's so sad!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heehee, gotcha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wha!? You were joking!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Duh! Come on, that's
the oldest one in the book!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you...!
Man, you really got me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should learn to be a little
less trusting of people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there you have it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. How about this?
Going on this trip with you...
It wasn't so bad, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah. Same here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, guess that means
we're meant for each other, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah! Gotcha again!
Seriously, you're too easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Again!? Come on,
cut it out, already!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, it's time to go...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right.
Well, I'm off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We probably won't ever meet again,
so take care of yourself.
Give my regards to your family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks, <Rutee>.
You take care, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See you!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
