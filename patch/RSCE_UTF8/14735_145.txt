<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, I just realized something.
Hold on a second, guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe we should step on both
pedestals at the same time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's split up
here and give it a go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet we need to
step on two of those
pedestals at the same time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Let's split
up and get it done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I have an idea,
if you don't mind.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is one possibility, but wouldn't
it work if we stand on those two
pedestals at the same time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure,
but I think it's worth a try.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm... I think the fact that
there are two pedestals
is the key to this mystery.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't we try
standing on both
of them at the same time?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's split up and try it.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys, can I
have a moment?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is just a hunch, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't we try to get on two
pedestals at the same time?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The trap <Rutee> got caught in
had a similar switch, where
both had to be hit at the same time.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's give it a try.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... Let me explain my idea.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe we could try stepping
on two pedestals at once?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it works, we'll be
killing two birds with one stone!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What? That's what
that means, right?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahaha!
I got it!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>!
I noticed something!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
And after thinkin'
good and hard about it,
I figured it out!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
All we gotta do is step on
those two switches at the same time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I betcha that'll do it!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Philia>, you're with me!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You guys! Get off your
butts and get a move on!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got an idea,
if you don't mind.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Earlier, when I was on that pedestal,
the other side was glowing too, right?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
So why don't we split up and
step on both pedestals at the same time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No harm in trying, right?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
