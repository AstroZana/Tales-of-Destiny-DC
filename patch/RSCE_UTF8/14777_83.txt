<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni! It's
glowing as brightly as ever!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you seen this land?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
A beautiful, lush, green world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the
Aethersphere. It cannot be
compared to the filthy earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
My people will soon awaken from
their slumber. The resurrection of
the heavens is almost upon us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This world belongs to everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't let this fake earth you've
created take all of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you Er'thers...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's finish this.
We, the Aetherians, and
you, the Er'thers...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll decide right now as to
which of us must perish!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
R-Ridiculous...!
That I, the King of
Heaven...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You see, <Miktran>?
This is our true power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not be defeated! I'm not
going to lose to the likes of you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eye of Atamoni! Give me your power!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's...! Are you trying to do
the same thing as <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know the consequences!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not lose to you
foolish earthlings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
True prosperity can only be achieved
when led by a supreme being!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that mean you're going to rule
over this world as an equal to Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Back off! We don't need to be
ruled by the likes of you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni should be a natural
presence in the human heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will decide our own future,
walking with our own two feet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the happiness and joy
we live for in this world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't need you to
tell us what to do!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You impudent...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the Eye's true power,
you will be punished by the
gods!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that light?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>, and the others
as well, do not be afraid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's right. We'll be
right by your side.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll take care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Trust in the bond we've built!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, of course we believe you.
We believe in all of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've tasted the bitter and
the sweet together. We're
irreplaceable partners.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're all of the same mind.
We're doing this together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, let's end it this time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We did it... We finally did it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's over...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no sign of <Miktran> anywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've won, haven't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohhhh, yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're safe now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>...
I'm glad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like I could write
the best song ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now all we have to do is
handle the Eye of Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this shaking?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No...! It seems Dycroft
has begun its descent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If we don't destroy it, the entire
outer shell will crash into the ground.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, the whole thing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're done for! We did
all this for nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can't you do something about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I'm afraid we're going to
have to make a last stand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...All of you, we need to talk. Get in
front of the Eye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There's only one way to stop it.
...We need to destroy the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We can do it now.
Trust us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll explain the procedure briefly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>First, we must pierce the Eye of
Atamoni with our four Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We then vibrate our core crystal and
the Eye of Atamoni in resonance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It will destroy the Eye from
within. And in a chain reaction,
disintegrate the outer shell as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Without the Eye, it's impossible
to maintain the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This way, we can stop the
damage to the surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn> and everyone else,
after piercing the Eye, leave here
immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>When the Eye of Atamoni is
destroyed, a tremendous amount
of energy will be released.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We're going to blow up Dycroft
with the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a minute. So you guys are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's goodbye, forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's the only way.
You must understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You never told us about this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
To keep us from changing our minds...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, you can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've come this far, and at
the last minute, there's no
way that's possible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go back to the surface
together! There's got to be
something else we can do!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah, you big idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're slowing down my resolve,
and it could destroy the earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a Swordian master, you must
do what must be done, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Let me go first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My time with you has been short,
but you have served the royal
family well until now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Igtenos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Best wishes to you <Woodrow>,
and glory to Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much, <Clemente>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Live well, <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come to think of it, you and I have
known each other a long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for everything, <Atwight>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It was fun, it was like having
a sister. I hope you stay that
way forever, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing more to say...
I believe in you!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice

<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which

1: Kicking a rock outside the
