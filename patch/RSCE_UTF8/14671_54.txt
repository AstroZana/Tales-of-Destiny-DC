<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must apologize to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Up to now, all I've done is question
whether or not you were ready...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...When in reality, I should have
been asking myself that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
"If the Master and Swordian's personas
are in sync, they will surely win"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So if we were the same person,
there wouldn't be any problem?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps not. However, we
would become predictable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. There are times where that becomes
a liability... Like now, for instance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora> must have realized this.
He must have wanted us to strengthen
ourselves more than just physically.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, the same is expected of you,
as well as the other Swordian Masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe he wanted to encourage us,
to strengthen our determination.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, I've been
thinking about something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the Swordian and the
master are the same person,
that's kinda like 1x1, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So no matter how you do it,
you just end up with another 1.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But if different people work
together, then the possibilities
are endless, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Between the two of us,
I know we can do this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will overcome this
final trial. Together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I will need your strength.
Will you fight alongside me, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it is time...
[ENDBLOCK]
?????
[ENDBLOCK]
...You've done well
to come here, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had a feeling we'd
meet someday. Maybe
even like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
?????
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Then there is no need
for me to give you my name.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've a keen eye. Good.
It seems you are prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Definitely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And what of the Swordian
version of me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no need for
you to even ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oho...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Dymlos>. I am the
Swordian wielded by <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
To fight alongside my master, <Stahn>,
and to ensure his victory...
That is my proud duty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I, <Dymlos> Timber, will
judge your worthiness myself!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, show me that you can defeat
me with your combined power!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let us begin!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have fought well...
Victory is yours, this day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like we all
came through, somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing left
for you to fear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have proven yourselves
to be good partners, and an
even better Swordian Team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We entrust this
world to you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
With this power, we ask that
you clear a path to the future!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must now say farewell to you,
our other selves... Our dear friends
from a thousand years back...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, <Dymlos>.
You can count on us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will not fail.
We will fulfill our duty!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick
from all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
