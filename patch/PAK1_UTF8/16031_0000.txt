I left my home behind, aimin' for the sky~ ♪
The wind's my guide, through the lows and highs~ ♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, <Johnny>'s new song!
[ENDBLOCK]
Reaching high, pointing to the sky!
Standing tall, strong, and sharp!♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's the song about this time, I wonder?
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm spikey, yeah~!♪ Sharper
than a tack, oh yeaaaaah~♪
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I have an idea who
the song's about, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, Number 30:
"One Sharp Head."
[ENDBLOCK]
...Huh?<x00>
