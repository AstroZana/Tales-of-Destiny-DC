<Stahn>, you're tougher than I am, so I want
you to take the lead in battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. Just leave it to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, are you okay with this? You sure
<Lion>'s not just using you?
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's not like that at all. I'll hold the enemy
off, and <Lion> will finish them!
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Right. It's a basic strategy, but 
also a very important one.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's sorta weird seeing those
two talk so casually...<x00>
