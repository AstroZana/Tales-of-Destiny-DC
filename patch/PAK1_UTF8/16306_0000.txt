Trash Mountain...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gas was spewing out from various
rocks throughout, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I noticed that too.
[ENDBLOCK]
If we use the Sorcerer's Ring in that place,
it might cause an explosion.
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have to be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's create a giant explosion.
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What the...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Reduce the number of rocks spewing
gas and we can journey further in.
[ENDBLOCK]
The explosion will be harmless!
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...
[ENDBLOCK]
It sounds pretty dangerous,
but it's worth a try.<x00>
