When we speak～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Images of winter appear～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Your heart's icy wall～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Cause tears to fall～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, make him stop singing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it great? I'm loving this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Dare to step out of line～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Like him, you'll feel small～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
He true nature hidden behind～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
A massive, icy wall～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, wonder who this song's about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess at your own risk.
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet we'll never know～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
What he's really like at all～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah～♪
