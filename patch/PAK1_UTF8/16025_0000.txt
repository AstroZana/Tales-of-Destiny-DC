So just what's it like, talking to a sword?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not that different from
talking to a person, I guess.
[ENDBLOCK]
It felt strange at first, but
I got used to it, eventually.
[ENDBLOCK]
Makes sense.
[ENDBLOCK]
You might not wanna do that in public, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
People might think you're crazy.
