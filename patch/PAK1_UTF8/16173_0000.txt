What's the matter <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, yeah, I was just... I was just
thinking about those kids...
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're sad leaving those kids behind, <Rutee>?
But you shouldn't let that get you down.
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what, they still love you <Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you see that!? Did you see what those
kids did when they hugged the mayor's wife?
[ENDBLOCK]
They looked up slowly, with their
cheeks slightly red, and said:

[ENDBLOCK]

Only I should be able to use it!
[ENDBLOCK]
When was it plagiarized?
Your big sis is ruined.<x00>
