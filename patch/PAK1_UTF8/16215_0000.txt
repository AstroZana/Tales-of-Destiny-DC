Master <Lion>, please remind me.
What kind of place is Harmentz, again?
[ENDBLOCK]
Last time I was there, it seemed like a quiet
village with only children and the elderly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, why would your sister go to
a place in the countryside like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Good question...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe she wanted to sell off her stolen
goods, but was instead sold out herself.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's usually how it goes, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, I get it. You're as sharp
as always, Young Master!<x00>
