[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis was attacked by monsters?
That's an unusual thing to happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though the lens have made them more violent,
those monsters were once ordinary wild animals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Their instincts wouldn't let them confront
an entity as intimidating as the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like they're being controlled
by a beastmaster...
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible someone forced them to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
But I've never heard of anyone who
could achieve such a thing. <x00>
