...Hahh...
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been sighing like that for a while now.
It's kind of annoying, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
But Young Master! You don't understand
what I've been through!
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> and <Atwight>...
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I can remember, those two would
were inseperable, worrying about one another...
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever <Atwight> was in trouble,
<Dymlos> would always come to her rescue!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>, as if by instinct,
would always cover <Dymlos> from afar!
[ENDBLOCK]
And I? Rear gaurd? Advanced guard?
[ENDBLOCK]
Caught right in the middle of those two lovebirds,
oblivious to anything around them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Stopping in the middle of battle, gazing at each other, focing
me to pretend not to notice, and do ALL THE FIGHTING!
[ENDBLOCK]
...I can't relive that!
[ENDBLOCK]
...I ...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Indeed, you do.<x00>
