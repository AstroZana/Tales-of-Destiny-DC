<Lion>'s title, "Hedge Knight"...
      What's that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
It means that although he's not officially a Knight
    of the Kingdom, he is still treated like one.
[ENDBLOCK]
So it's like being an officer?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maaan, that must be nice!
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of envying someone else's circumstances,
   how about focusing on bettering your own?
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know! I'm my own person, after all.<x00>
