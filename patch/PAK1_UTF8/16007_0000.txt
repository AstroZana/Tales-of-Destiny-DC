<center>Why would <Hugo> want to revive
the Aetherian Kingdom?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know. I suppose we won't
know unless we ask him directly.
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know how he would find joy ruling
a world where no one else exists.
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't make sense.
[ENDBLOCK]
Who can say...
[ENDBLOCK]
But, one thing's for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
There can be no happiness in a
world that sacrifices so many.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
We must stop <Hugo>'s ambitions.
No matter what it takes.<x00>
