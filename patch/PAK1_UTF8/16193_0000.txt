In order to protect King <Woodrow>, I would have
immediately pierced your heart with an arrow.
[ENDBLOCK]

I thought you were only a child, <Chelsea>, but no...
you've become such a fine young woman...
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so happy I could... lay my hands upon...
my daughter... one final time...
[ENDBLOCK]
I can... pass... in peace...
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What are you saying!?
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the only mother I have...!
I-If I lose you, then... I'll...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Noooooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, hold it! This is going beyond
an ad-lib! You're flat out changing the story!
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoops, sorry! Guess we overdid it a little...
