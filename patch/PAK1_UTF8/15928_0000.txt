I'd say <Lion>'s sacrifice redeemed
him. I refuse to condemn the guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't agree. What <Lion> did was unforgivable!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, hey! Ain't that a little harsh?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true that he saved us in the end, and I'm thankful...
but to part like that was simply horrid.
[ENDBLOCK]
It made us feel like we abandoned him!
[ENDBLOCK]
...At this rate, <Rutee> will...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there something wrong with <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, no... It's nothing.<x00>
