Hmmm... Now that her memories are back,
we get to know the real <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
She's certainly more composed now. She's
different than my first impression of her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Way back, she'd always be kinda spaced out, and
the strangest things would catch her interest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, is there something bothering you? I'll
be happy to give you advice if you need it!
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Uhm, thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
She's just as kind and
caring as before, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
That hasn't changed, at least.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?<x00>
