Even though Emperor <Tiberius> is gone,
things aren't quite back to normal yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I'd rather leave that hassle to my family
and <Fayte>, but... Who knows what'll happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think will happen to
Aquaveil from here on out?
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Tiberius didn't have an heir, so it'll
be hard for Terazzi to continue on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps this is a chance for Aquaveil's
Great Tale of Unification to continue...<x00>
