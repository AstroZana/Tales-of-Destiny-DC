Okay, so here, <Dymlos> says..
[ENDBLOCK]
"...You've done well to come here, <Stahn>"...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Then I reply, uhm...
[ENDBLOCK]
"I had a feeling we'd meet someday...
Maybe even like this..."
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmh, should I say it like that, though?
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... I know that voice anywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Wanna rehearse together?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! Mr. <Dymlos>! Long time no see!
[ENDBLOCK]
It really has been. When I'm a sword, they
record my lines in the studio, ya know?
[ENDBLOCK]
I rarely see anyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha, yeah, we don't usually get to meet up!
We should be thankful we got the chance!
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the only scene in the game where
<Stahn> and <Dymlos> meet face-to-face, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! Mr. <Dymlos>! It's been so long!
[ENDBLOCK]
Yoo! If it ain't <Rutee>! How ya been?<x00>
