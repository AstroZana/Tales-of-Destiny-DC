<Johnny>, where do you find the
inspiration for your songs?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a great question. Look over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Philia> and <Kongman>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, <Kongman> just offered her a flower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> politely refused it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> must be devastated!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, Number 11: "<Kongman>'s
Unrequited Love."
