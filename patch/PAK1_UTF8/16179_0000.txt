Question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
The bridge in front of you has a warning sign.
"None may cross over this bridge." What do you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a tough one...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmm, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
I would build a new bridge, one that
could be used equally by everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm, this is a riddle...
[ENDBLOCK]
That's such a kind response. It's no wonder...
Those who must rule must also think differently.
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected of Lord <Woodrow>♪
[ENDBLOCK]
...Can't you just cross under it?<x00>
