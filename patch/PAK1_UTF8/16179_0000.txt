Question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
The bridge in front of you has a warning written
on it "Do not cross this bridge." What do you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a tough one...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmm, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
We can build a new bridge that
can be used by everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm, this is a riddle...
[ENDBLOCK]
How kind of you.
One with the makings of a king thinks differently.
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected of you, Lord <Woodrow>♪
[ENDBLOCK]
...You can just cross through the center.<x00>
