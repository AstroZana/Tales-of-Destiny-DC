Dear Gramps and <Lilith>.
Right now, I'm in Shiden...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, are you writing another
letter to your family?
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, not "another," exactly...
[ENDBLOCK]
I, uh, kinda didn't get a chance
to send the last one...
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I want to get
this one written right away!
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you did, there's no way that
letter will reach Fitzgald from here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Whuh? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you even know what
"national isolation" means?<x00>
