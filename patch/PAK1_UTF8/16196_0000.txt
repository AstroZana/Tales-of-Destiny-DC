Hey, <Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You ever play "Tales of Phantasia?"
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
You're kidding! You're the main character of this game,
and you don't even know about Tales of Phantasia?
[ENDBLOCK]
The hero Cress' peaceful daily life is
suddenly and cruelly torn away from him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Having lost all that is dear to him, Cress sets out
on a journey, filled with determination.
[ENDBLOCK]
From there, Cress' epic jouney that
spans the whole world leads to...
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Leads to what!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, that's all I'm saying. You'll just
have to play it yourself and find out!
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Was that just a
commercial or something?
[ENDBLOCK]
