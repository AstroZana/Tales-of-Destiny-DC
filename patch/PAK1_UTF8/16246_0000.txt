Okay, this time, I tried my
hand at making hamburgers!
[ENDBLOCK]
I made sure to follow the cookbook
precisely. It should be perfectly fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
...And you're serving it to me, why?
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well, <Rutee> wouldn't eat it, no matter
how many times I told her I followed the recipe...
[ENDBLOCK]
Then take it to <Stahn>, instead.
He'll eat anything, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't do something
so embarrassing!
[ENDBLOCK]
...Are you actually trying
to make me mad?<x00>
