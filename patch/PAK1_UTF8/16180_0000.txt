[ENDBLOCK]
We finally finished the Discovery Book.
This is the fruit of our labor...
[ENDBLOCK]
We have really seen a lot. It is
almost too much to remember.
[ENDBLOCK]
Looking back, there were so many things
about this world we had no knowledge of.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I thought I had seen it all.
Clearly there was so much more to see.
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is so vast.
[ENDBLOCK]
I learned a lot about this world through books,
but its mysteries should be enjoyed in person.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful for this opportunity. A good ruler
must have broad knowledge of the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish those kids could experience this...
[ENDBLOCK]
We aren't finished.
[ENDBLOCK]
There has to still be plenty of things
to discover and many people to meet.
[ENDBLOCK]
A new journey of discovery begins!<x00>
