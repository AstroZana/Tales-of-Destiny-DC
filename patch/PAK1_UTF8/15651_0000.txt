If we measure the distance
between here and Hamentz...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Factor in the cost of meals...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, it doesn't add up!
[ENDBLOCK]
What's got <Rutee> all worked up?
[ENDBLOCK]
She's calculating the cost of our trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
When it comes to financial management,
you can leave it to her.

I guess we could skip lunch today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe just a side dish and add some

...Is it really a good idea
to leave this to her?<x00>
