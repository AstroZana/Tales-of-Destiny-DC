Excuse me, Miss <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
What is the "Tales of" series...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Philia>! You don't know about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
It all started with "Tales of Phantasia."
Then came our game, "Tales of Destiny."
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, "Tales of Eternia", then "Tales of Destiny 2."
[ENDBLOCK]
..."Tales of Symphonia",
"Tales of Rebirth"...
[ENDBLOCK]
"Tales of Legendia",
"Tales of the Abyss"...
[ENDBLOCK]
And there's more, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Not just games, either! Drama CD's, books, and
OVAs, too! It's more than just an RPG series!
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun!
I should go buy some of these right now!
[ENDBLOCK]
The RPG series, "Tales Of", that has
captured people's hearts. Out now!<x00>
