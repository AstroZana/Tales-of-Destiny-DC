[ENDBLOCK]
Your master is quite unique, <Atwight>.
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not a bad kid at heart...
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that you have chosen an
    interesting master as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's good that he has a straightforward
personality, but he's too good-natured.
[ENDBLOCK]
He is still inexperienced with a sword.
We're going to have to train him well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe. That sounds like fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, <Atwight>...
Has that time come...?
[ENDBLOCK]
  I'm wondering that myself. First
of all, I don't know where to begin.
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that our awakening
    is not a bad omen.<x00>
