<Hugo> and <Lion>... from the start, those two
never had a normal father-son relationship.
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how <Lion> felt about <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Did he like him, did he hate him,
or did he feel something else...?
[ENDBLOCK]
I know it's hard not to think about it,
but... I'll tell you this, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
One should not act on behalf of the dead.
One should act for the sake of the living.
[ENDBLOCK]
...I understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Okay, let's move on.<x00>
