So heavy... If I knew we'd find so much lens,
I would have sold some sooner...
[ENDBLOCK]
If the weight of the lens slows you down,
we may encounter trouble during combat.
[ENDBLOCK]
How about just dropping some?
[ENDBLOCK]
Just throw away our hard-earned lens?
You've got to be kidding me.
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the only solution, I just won't fight!

<Rutee>, ever heard of "getting one's
priorities straight?".<x00>
