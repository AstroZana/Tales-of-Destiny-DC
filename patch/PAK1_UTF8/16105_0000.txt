So heavy... I should have sold the lens
sooner if this was going to happen...
[ENDBLOCK]
If the weight of the lens slows me
down, I'll be in trouble during combat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you just get rid of some?
[ENDBLOCK]
You want me to throw away the lens
I've got? You've got to be kidding me.
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, I won't fight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, do you know the
term "Game Over?"<x00>
