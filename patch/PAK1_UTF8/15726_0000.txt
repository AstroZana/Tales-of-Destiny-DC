The people here in Calvalese
have a hard life, don't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard they have to endure just as much
even if they move out of the country.
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems some even go so far as to
hide the fact that they're from Calvalese.

I hope <Baruk> succeeds in making
this country a better place to live...
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, same!<x00>
