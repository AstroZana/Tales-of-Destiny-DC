Lord <Woodrow>, what do you
intend to do after this battle?
[ENDBLOCK]
I will return to Phandaria and
fulfill my duties as king.
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you thought about
who your queen will be?
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. As king it is my
duty to do so.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be running for that position immediately!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Alba> will surely give me
a hard time if that happens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> is a very clever man.
He always dodges her advances so gently.
[ENDBLOCK]
He's so magnanimous...<x00>
