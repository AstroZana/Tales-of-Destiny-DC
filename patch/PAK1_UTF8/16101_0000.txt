Was there a champion before you, <Kongman>?
[ENDBLOCK]
There was a legendary champion, or whatever
they called them, at one point.
[ENDBLOCK]
No way he's better than me, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahahahahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! You're referring to Aunt Maggie, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that story before.
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? You guys, uh, know
about "Rowdy Maggie"?
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Kongman>? The color
has drained from your face.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh~~! Please forgive me~! I don't
want her coming after me~!
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey! <Kongman>!<x00>
