Was there ever a champion before <Kongman>?
[ENDBLOCK]
There was a legendary champion, or
whatever they called them, at one point.
[ENDBLOCK]
They're not nearly as good as me though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahahahahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! You're referring to
Aunt Maggie, aren't you.
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that story before.
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? You guys, uh, know
about "Rough Rider Maggie?"
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Kongman>?
You don't look so good.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hee~~! Give me a break~!
I don't want to be near that woman~!
